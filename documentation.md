# Flight Delay Prediction Documentation

## Introduction to Flight Delay Prediction
Flight delay prediction involves analyzing historical flight data and weather conditions to predict whether a flight will be delayed. This project uses logistic regression to classify flights as delayed or on-time.

## Principles of Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a binary classification model that estimates the probability of an event occurring based on a set of independent variables.

## Implementation in This Project
The project implements logistic regression using R, providing functions for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and visualization.

## Usefulness of This Project
- **Predictive Analysis**: Helps airlines and passengers anticipate delays, allowing for better planning and resource allocation.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Identifies key factors contributing to delays, enabling targeted improvements in airline operations.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Enhances passenger experience by providing accurate delay forecasts.

## Key Features
- **Data Exploration**: Analyzes trends and missing values in flight and weather datasets.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Merges datasets and extracts relevant features for modeling.
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity to assess model performance.
- **Visualization**: Plots confusion matrices and feature importance to visualize key insights.
